# pta.waynecounty_scraping_with_multiThreading

Scrap this website https://pta.waynecounty.com/
1. First you have to create Virtualenv
2. Install the requirement by typing "pip install -r requirement.txt"
3. In 'abc.xlsx' put the IDs of Tax payers of "Wayne Michigan"
4. Now you can use both the file "single thread" and "multithreading" for scraping. 

Thank you
